# Glorp v1

This is the first iteration of Glorp, written in Java.<br>
Thhis version was abandoned because Java is difficult to compile to native executables and Rust has many advantages over it.<br>
<br><br>
An absolutely terrible "untyped" programming language. Glorp is interpreted to Java and run by the Java compiler.<br>
All values are treated as doubles. Strings are converted to ASCII codes and handled as numbers. Everything is either truthy or falsy.<br>
